# Quilt

Quilt is a framework for building complex web projects. It is focused on building [web applications](./documentation/projects/apps), but can also help you build [shared packages](./documentation/projects/packages) and [backend services](./documentation/projects/services).

Quilt tries to deliver a great experience of using [TypeScript](./documentation/technology/typescript), [GraphQL](./documentation/technology/graphql), and [Preact](./documentation/technology/preact). You can still use Quilt without using these technologies, but we focus on optimizing the holistic experience of using them together. Quilt also tries to help make it easy to run a curated collection of [other popular web tools](./documentation/technologies) on all the projects in your repo.

There are a lot of great web frameworks out there. Quilt tries to strike a particular balance of flexibility, scalability, and safety that differentiates it from other frameworks. This set of tradeoffs is not “right” for every project, though! You should read about Quilt’s [design priorities](./documentation/priorities.md) to see if Quilt is right for you.
