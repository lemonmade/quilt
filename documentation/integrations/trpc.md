# Using [tRPC](https://trpc.io)

tRPC lets you build type-safe APIs that are easy to call from your front-end. It lets you define a clear contract over the inputs and outputs of your backend, without you needing to worry about REST or GraphQL endpoints.

> **Note:** this guide walks you through how to add tRPC to an existing Quilt app. If you are starting from scratch, Quilt’s [`create` command](../getting-started.md#creating-an-app) provides a tRPC template that will set up a tRPC-powered, server-rendering app for you. Just pick the [**tRPC template**](../getting-started.md#app-templates), or pass `--template trpc` to the `create` command.

Because tRPC has both a client and server component, you’ll need to follow a few steps to use it in a [Quilt application](../projects/apps):

1. [Create a tRPC router](#create-a-trpc-router)
1. [Expose tRPC through your app server](#expose-trpc-through-your-app-server)
1. [Render tRPC’s React providers](#render-trpcs-react-providers)
1. [Use tRPC’s React hooks](#use-trpcs-react-hooks)

To follow this guide, you’ll need a Quilt app with a [custom server](../projects/apps/server.md). You’ll also need to install [tRPC’s server and React dependencies](https://trpc.io/docs/react), and [`@quilted/react-query`](../../integrations/react-query/) (tRPC uses [`@tanstack/react-query`](https://tanstack.com/query/v4) for client-side data fetching):

```bash
# npm
npm install --save-dev @trpc/client @trpc/server @trpc/react-query @tanstack/react-query @quilted/react-query
# pnpm
pnpm add --save-dev @trpc/client @trpc/server @trpc/react-query @tanstack/react-query @quilted/react-query
# yarn
yarn add --dev @trpc/client @trpc/server @trpc/react-query @tanstack/react-query @quilted/react-query
```

## Create a tRPC router

The first step in any tRPC project is [setting up a router](https://trpc.io/docs/quickstart). This process defines what queries and mutations are available through tRPC, and allows you to validate their inputs.

As an example, let’s create a simple router that will respond to a `message` query by returning a friendly greeting. Assuming we have a Quilt app in the `app` directory, we could define our tRPC router in an `app/trpc.ts` file like so:

```ts
// app/trpc.ts

import {initTRPC} from '@trpc/server';

const t = initTRPC.create();

export const appRouter = t.router({
  message: t.procedure
    .input((val: unknown) => {
      if (typeof val === 'string') return val;
      throw new Error(`Invalid input: ${typeof val}`);
    })
    .query(({input}) => `Hello, ${input}!`),
});

// Export type router type signature, not the router itself.
// Our client-side code will use this type to infer the
// procedures that are defined.
export type AppRouter = typeof appRouter;
```

The rest of our app will use this router (and its associated TypeScript type) to get automatic type-safety.

## Expose tRPC through your app server

tRPC needs to be accessible through an API endpoint on your server. If you have created a [“basic” Quilt app](../getting-started.md#app-templates), you will have a customizable server in your `app/server.tsx` file. You can add an `/api` path that will contain all of your tRPC procedures bya adding the following route to your [request router](../features/request-routing.md):

```tsx
// app/server.tsx

import {RequestRouter} from '@quilted/quilt/request-router';
import {fetchRequestHandler} from '@trpc/server/adapters/fetch';

import {appRouter} from './trpc.ts';

const router = new RequestRouter();

router.any(
  'api',
  (request) => {
    return fetchRequestHandler({
      endpoint: '/api',
      req: request,
      router: appRouter,
      createContext: () => ({}),
    });
  },
  {exact: false},
);

// Other routes, like the one to render your React app, go here...
```

For more details on setting up the tRPC server, you can read up on [tRPC’s `fetch` adaptor](https://trpc.io/docs/fetch), which supports the request and response format used by Quilt’s request router library.

## Render tRPC’s React providers

tRPC provides a collection of [React providers and hooks](https://trpc.io/docs/react#client-side) to make use of procedures in your React components. In addition to its own providers, tRPC also uses [`@tanstack/react-query`](https://tanstack.com/query/v4) for client-side data fetching, so you will also need to use Quilt’s [react-query library](../../integrations/react-query/) for full server-side rendering of tRPC queries.

First, we will export tRPC’s React utilities from a shared location in our repo. These utilities include both the providers you need to wrap around your entire app, and the hooks that components in your app will use to make tRPC queries. We’ll create a `app/shared/trpc.ts` file for this, because the basic template creates handy aliases for files in the `shared` directory:

```ts
// app/shared/trpc.ts

import {createTRPCReact} from '@trpc/react-query';

// Get access to our app’s router type signature, which will
// provide strong typing on the queries and mutations we can
// perform.
import {type AppRouter} from '../trpc.ts';

export const trpc = createTRPCReact<AppRouter>();
```

The basic app renders a number of “global” context providers in the main `app/App.tsx` module. We can add the necessary tRPC providers there as well:

```tsx
// app/App.tsx

import type {RenderableProps} from 'preact';
import {useMemo} from 'preact/hooks';
import {useInitialUrl} from '@quilted/quilt/navigate';

import {httpBatchLink} from '@trpc/client';
import {QueryClient} from '@tanstack/react-query';
import {ReactQueryContext} from '@quilted/react-query';

import {trpc} from '~/shared/trpc.ts';

// This is your default App component. When creating a template, it
// will already be defined, so you will just need to wrap the main
// part of your app in the Trpc component defined below.
export default function App() {
  return (
    <AppContext>
      <Trpc>{/* existing children of AppContext */}</Trpc>
    </AppContext>
  );
}

interface TrpcProps {}

function Trpc({children}: RenderableProps<TrpcProps>) {
  const initialUrl = useInitialUrl();

  const queryClient = useMemo(() => new QueryClient(), []);

  const trpcClient = useMemo(
    () =>
      trpc.createClient({
        links: [
          // We need to use an absolute URL so that queries will
          // work during server-side rendering
          httpBatchLink({url: new URL('/api', initialUrl).href}),
        ],
      }),
    [initialUrl],
  );

  return (
    <trpc.Provider client={trpcClient} queryClient={queryClient}>
      <ReactQueryContext client={queryClient}>{children}</ReactQueryContext>
    </trpc.Provider>
  );
}
```

## Use tRPC’s React hooks

Now, for the important part: using tRPC to fetch data for our UI! We can use the `shared/trpc.ts` file we created earlier to access our strongly-typed hooks for querying tRPC data from any component in our app:

```tsx
import {trpc} from '~/shared/trpc.ts';

export function Greeting() {
  // Get the name to greet from the URL search params
  const name = useCurrentUrl().searchParams.get('name');
  const {data, isLoading} = trpc.message.useQuery(name ?? 'Unknown user');

  return <p>{isLoading ? 'Loading...' : data}</p>;
}
```

## Optimizing tRPC queries during server rendering

Using the instructions in the rest of this guide, your tRPC queries will be run during [server side rendering](../features/server-rendering.md) so that the initial HTML content of your page includes all the necessary data. However, the tRPC “link” we created in the previous section connects using HTTP, the same way that tRPC will make queries during client-side rendering. Creating an HTTP request to satisfy these queries on the server is wasteful if you are implementing your tRPC server in the same application as your server-rendering code, as we are in the previous section.

Quilt provides an additional set of utilities for optimizing this setup. It allows you to create a custom link during server rendering that will directly call your tRPC router, instead of calling it over HTTP. To get started, install the `@quilted/trpc` package:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @quilted/trpc
# pnpm
pnpm add --save-dev @quilted/trpc
# yarn
yarn add --dev @quilted/trpc
```

To use this optimization, you’ll need to accept a different tRPC link when server-rendering your app. You can add it as a prop to your root `App` component, and pass it through to tRPC’s context providers:

```tsx
// app/App.tsx

import type {RenderableProps} from 'preact';
import {useMemo} from 'preact/hooks';
import {useInitialUrl} from '@quilted/quilt/navigate';

import {httpBatchLink, type TRPCClient} from '@trpc/client';
import {createTRPCReact} from '@trpc/react-query';

import {QueryClient} from '@tanstack/react-query';
import {ReactQueryContext} from '@quilted/react-query';

import {trpc} from '~/shared/trpc.ts';

export interface Props {
  trpc?: TrpcProps['client'];
}

// This is your default App component. When creating a template, it
// will already be defined, so you will just need to wrap the main
// part of your app in the Trpc component defined below.
export default function App({trpc}: Props) {
  return (
    <AppContext>
      <Trpc client={trpc}>{/* existing children of AppContext */}</Trpc>
    </AppContext>
  );
}

interface TrpcProps {
  client?: TRPCClient<any>;
}

function Trpc({client, children}: RenderableProps<TrpcProps>) {
  const initialUrl = useInitialUrl();

  const queryClient = useMemo(() => new QueryClient(), []);

  // Use the custom client if it was provided, otherwise use the
  // default HTTP-based client.
  const trpcClient = useMemo(
    () =>
      client ??
      trpc.createClient({
        links: [
          // We need to use an absolute URL so that queries will
          // work during server-side rendering
          httpBatchLink({url: new URL('/api', initialUrl).href}),
        ],
      }),
    [initialUrl],
  );

  return (
    <trpc.Provider client={trpcClient} queryClient={queryClient}>
      <ReactQueryContext client={queryClient}>{children}</ReactQueryContext>
    </trpc.Provider>
  );
}
```

Then, in your server entrypoint, pass in your custom link. You’ll use your tRPC router (the object created with `t.router()`) to create a “direct” tRPC connection using the utilities in `@quilted/trpc`:

```tsx
import {createDirectClient} from '@quilted/trpc/server';
import {fetchRequestHandler} from '@trpc/server/adapters/fetch';
import type {} from '@quilted/cloudflare';

import App from './App.tsx';
import {appRouter} from './trpc.ts';

const router = new RequestRouter();

// Make sure to keep your existing tRPC HTTP routes, as they
// will be used when your app runs on the client.
router.any(
  'api',
  (request) => {
    return fetchRequestHandler({
      endpoint: '/api',
      req: request,
      router: appRouter,
      createContext: () => ({}),
    });
  },
  {exact: false},
);

const reactHandler = createServerRender(
  () => <App trpc={createDirectClient(appRouter)} />,
  {
    assets: createBrowserAssets(),
  },
);
```

That’s it! Your application code and tRPC procedures don’t need to change to make use of this optimization, they’ll just benefit from the direct JavaScript calls during server-rendering.
