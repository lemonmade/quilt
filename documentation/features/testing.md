# Testing

Testing is a critical layer of safety for your application as it (or the team that works on it) scales up. Testing can also serve as a useful tool for documenting the many permutations a given component needs to support.

Quilt provides a `test` command ([`quilt test`](../reference/commands/test)) that will run tests for your entire project using [Jest](). You can bring any testing library that supports Preact/ React into these tests, but Quilt also provides its own set of component-oriented testing utilities.
