# Development tools

Quilt provides lightweight integrations with a number of possible development tools. These tools are also installed as part of the [project templates](./getting-started.md) you can use to quickly get started with a package, app, or server.

Quilt’s should work well with any set of JavaScript tools, even if they aren’t mentioned in this document. Our goal is to provide an optional set of heavily curated tools that can get you started quickly, and that can support a project well into production. As your project gets more complicated, you may will likely add other tools, or change the tools Quilt provides altogether. We’ll strive to pick a modern set of [small-but-mighty](./priorities.md#small-but-mighty) tools that pack a serious punch, but that are easily replaceable and evolvable alongside a project’s needs.

We tried to pick one tool for a few common development tasks:

- [Dependency management](#dependency-management-with-pnpm)
- [Local development](#local-development-with-vite)
- [Type checking](#type-checking-with-typescript)
- [Building for production](#building-for-production-with-rollup)
- [Testing](#testing-with-vitest)
- [Formatting](#formatting-with-prettier)
- [Running scripts](#running-scripts-with-tsx)

## Dependency management with pnpm

## Local development with Vite

## Type checking with TypeScript

## Building for production with Rollup

## Testing with Vitest

## Formatting with Prettier

## Running scripts with `tsx`
